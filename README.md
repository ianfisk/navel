# navel

A Vimium-like chrome extension personalized to my wants and desires. Currently supported commands include:

`ctrl+l` - **Annotate Links**

Highligh clickable elements with annotations that can be used to navigate the internet mouse free. Enter an annotation's label to select that element. Pro tip: hold `shift` while selecting an annotation and if it is a link it will be opened in a new tab.

`ctrl+d` - **Duplicate**

Ever wonder why Chrome doesn't have a shortcut for duplicating the current tab? Yeah, me too. This fixes that.

`ctrl+b` - **Go Back**

Navigate back. This is most useful _when_ using a mouse and you want to go back without moving the mouse all the way up to the back button or moving your left hand over to hit `cmd+left arrow`. Yes, I'm lazy, but these movements really add up.

`ctrl+f` - **Go Forward**

Guess

`ctrl+j` - **Scroll Down**

Scroll down just the right amount.

`ctrl+k` - **Scroll Up**

Scroll up just the right amount.

## FAQ

### Why is it called navel?

That's a good question. I wanted a name that was fun, catchy, not too serious, etc., and "navel" came to mind as a combination of navigate + element (the main purpose I wrote the extension is for mouse-free link navigation). Plus this means the icon can be a little orange. (Life is about the little wins.)
